## Exploring Hierarchical Structures
I noticed that you have an interest in what I like to call dirtrees ðŸŒ²

Head over to a directory of your choice and give this command a try
```sh
echo '```sh' > yayauptree.md && tree -F . >> yayauptree.md && echo '```' >> yayauptree.md
```



Make sure to have tree installed on your machine. <br>
**Get it** from the **advanced package tool** aka `apt`
```sh
sudo apt-get install tree
```
