# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

This was a very introduction week. Not heavy instructions more to get folks a good welcome and get them on board.

- We discussed security and its importance
- Also the importance of good architecture going to the benefits of the microservice architecture.
- I also got the chance to have some hands on Lucidchart, i'm well practical with drawio & visio at work so this felt very similar
- We then discussed some AWS stuff and the importance of working under an IAM rather than root.
- We did great operations related to budget, alerts and to have sense of your expenses on AWS Cost explorer.

Here is a reminder for you.

| Pillar | Focus |
| --- | --- |
| Operational Excellence | Utilizing a fully automated operations pipeline for IT operations |
| Security | Ensuring that security accounts are always up to date |
| Reliability | Building highly reliable systems that self-heal and recover quickly |
| Performance Efficiency | Ensuring that systems are running at peak performance efficiently |
| Cost Optimization | Reducing costs by utilizing cost optimization principles |
| Business Agility | Enabling rapid responses to changing customer requirements and market trends |

Andrew has provided more great architecture, such as the Twitter System Arch and others that may be useful; check them out from [here!](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/3dd58bb4-27dc-440d-9dc0-9bcd0154a346/edit?viewport_loc=224%2C471%2C1939%2C867%2Cu~1sbYNXU9q3&invitationId=inv_b811bc56-a51b-4481-a306-2f347e725dc5)
