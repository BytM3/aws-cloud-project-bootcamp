# A Path Towards Modern Solutions
A monolithic architecture is a traditional way of designing and developing apps. In a mono-based architecture, all of the application's code and data are contained in a single codebase. 

![Cloud Native self-made Banner](assets/week0/cloud-native.png)
- **It is difficult to develop**. Because all of the code and data are in a single codebase, not practical to track changes and make updates which lead to errors and bugs.
- **It is difficult to deploy**. The entire application is deployed as a single unit, when you deploy changes to the application you can affect other parts of the application.
- **It is difficult to scale**. If the application experiences increased traffic, it can be difficult to scale the application without targeting performance.

In addressing the challenge at hand, a profound and enduring resolution emerged - the adoption of a cloud-native architecture. 

This forward-thinking approach harnessed the power of cloud technologies to reshape the very fabric of our systems, opening up a world of possibilities and transformative potential

## Build Scalable and Resilient Applications
**Cloud-native architecture** is a design methodology that utilizes cloud services to allow dynamic and agile application development techniques that take a modular approach to building, running, and updating software through a suite of cloud-based microservices versus a monolithic application infrastructure.

Before the release of the app, cloud architects typically follow these steps to ensure its successful implementation.
1. ***Define the project goals***<br>
The first step towards great cloud-native architecture is the discussions with both the technical and business team to ensure that the project's objectives are met in its entirety. It is also important to consider [the risks, assumptions, and constraints](#additional-considerations) that may be involved in the project.
2. ***Design the architecture***<br>
This step involves breaking down the application into microservices, which are small, independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. Designs and its type will be [break down below](#âš¡get-started-now).
3. ***Implement the microservices***<br>
Developing the microservices using a variety of technologies and deploying them to the cloud. The cloud platform e.g AWS will provide the infrastructure for running the microservices and managing their scaling.<br>
The Âµservices can be developed using a variety of technologies e.g. as Java, Go, or [**Python our case**](../backend-flask/README.md).
4. ***Test and deploy the application***<br>
The final step (stating point) is to test and deploy the application. This involves [testing the microservices individually](week1.md#containerize-flask-app) and then [testing the application as a whole](week1.md#running-multiple-containers).

| Goals                            |   Evidence     |
|----------------------------------|--------|
| Define the project goals         |   [PM](resources/project-scenario.md)      |
| Design the architecture          |  [Architectures ](#types-of-architectural-diagrams)     |
| Implement the microservices      |  [Code Structure](../backend-flask/services/)      |
| Test and deploy the application  |  [W1 using Docker](week1.md)    |

This project application is constructed upon this robust architecture, and we have committed to accomplishing each step outlined above. 

## The Fundamental Pillars of Project Management
In the realm of project management, certain key factors play a pivotal role in shaping the destiny of any endeavor. 

Before proceeding - prioritize reviewing [the project scenario and its objectives](resources/project-scenario.md).

***The Iron Triangle*** is a project management concept that refers to the three constraints that are commonly considered to be the most important in determining the success or failure of a project. 

**The three constraints are,**

| Constraint | Description |
|---|---|
| **Time** | Refers to the amount of time available to complete a project. The project needs to be completed within a specific timeframe, and any delays can have a significant impact on the project's success. |
| **Cost** | Refers to the budget available to complete a project. The project needs to be completed within the allocated budget, and any cost overruns can have a significant impact on the project's success. |
| **Scope** | Refers to the goals, deliverables, and features of a project. The project needs to meet the agreed-upon scope, and any changes or deviations from the scope can have a significant impact on the project's success. |

**Benefits of the Iron Triangle**

The Iron Triangle provides several benefits for project managers, including:

* It helps to ensure that projects are completed on time, within budget, and with the agreed-upon scope.
* It provides a framework for making decisions about project trade-offs.
* It helps to identify and manage risks.
* It provides a common language for communicating with stakeholders.

**How to Use the Iron Triangle**

The Iron Triangle can be used to manage projects by following these steps:

1. Identify the three constraints for your project.
2. Set realistic expectations for each constraint.
3. Monitor the constraints throughout the project.
4. Make trade-offs as needed to ensure that the project is completed successfully.

#### **Additional Considerations,**

| Concept | Description | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Risks** | Events that could happen and have a negative impact on the project | Late delivery, user commitment, technical problems |
| **Assumptions** | Things that we believe to be true but that haven't been proven | The budget being approved, sufficient network bandwidth, the availability of key resources |
| **Constraints** | Limitations that the project must adhere to | Time, budget, technical requirements |

Understanding the three constraints and how they interact, also the assumptions and the risks project managers can increase their chances of success.

## Develop a Common Dictionary
Have you ever wondered what would be a valuable tip I could share with you? READ.
- **Ask questions** â€” Don't be afraid to ask questions, even if you think they're obvious. This will help to ensure that everyone is on the same page.
- **Play "be-the-packet"** â€” This exercise can help you to understand how data is transmitted through the network.
- **Document everything** â€” This includes both technical and non-technical documentation.

**By doing so, you can achive the following :==)**
- *Prevents misunderstandings*<br>
Everyone will be using the same terminology, so there will be no confusion about what different terms mean.
- *Makes communication easier* <br>It will be easier for people to understand each other and to collaborate on projects.
- *Improves the quality of the product* <br>When everyone is on the same page, the product will be more likely to be successful.
How to Overcome Challenges

Lastly. Be patient. It takes time.ðŸ’¯<br>
Be consistent and use the same terminology throughout the project and be willing to compromise. 

Not everyone will agree on everything, but it's important to find common ground.

# Types of Architectural Diagrams

Architectural diagrams are visual representations of a software system's architecture. They are used to communicate the system's design to stakeholders, and to help developers understand how the system works.

There are three main types of architectural diagrams:

- **Conceptual diagrams (aka napkin designs)** provide a high-level overview of the system. They show the system's major components and how they interact.
- **Logical diagrams (aka blueprints)** show the system's functionality in more detail. They show how the system's components interact, and how data flows through the system.
- **Physical diagrams** show the physical components of the system, such as hardware, software, and networks. They show how these components are connected, and how they interact with each other.

Each type of architectural diagram has its own purpose, and they are often used together to provide a complete picture of the system's architecture.

### **When to Use Each Type of Architectural Diagram**
- **Conceptual diagrams** are used early in the development process, when the system's requirements are still being defined. They are a quick and easy way to communicate the overall idea of the system to stakeholders.
- **Logical diagrams** are used later in the development process, when the system's functionality is being designed. They are a more detailed way to communicate the system's design to developers.
- **Physical diagrams** are used in the final stages of development, when the system is being implemented. They are a way to communicate the system's design to system administrators and other technical staff.

Architectural diagrams are a valuable tool for communicating the design of a software system. They really can be used to expand your vision to whoever. 

### How to Create an Architectural Diagram
here are many different tools that can be used to create architectural diagrams. I personally like first two!

- Lucidchart (Paid)
- draw.io (FREE)
- Microsoft Visio (Paid)

I used **Draw.io** extensively in weeks 5, 6, 7, 8 and nine. 

In week 10, you'll also find CloudFormation architectures *I* built using **Lucidchart**, which highlights the potential differences. <br>Logic, comparing a free product and a paid one.

In Lucidchart, you can conveniently access built-in shapes by navigating to "File" â†’ "Import Data," making it an ideal platform for working with AWS-related projects.
- Here is a [DRAWIO Sample.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yaya2devops/aws-cloud-project-bootcamp/main/journal/assets/week9/CI-CD-Architect/ci-cd-architect.png)
- Here is a [Lucidchart Sample.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yaya2devops/aws-cloud-project-bootcamp/a22ddff9354e1ad1b680ed92383f5b0430d4f608/journal/assets/week11/big-bundle/0-App-Network-Buleprint.svg)

Find additional [diagramming tools, and AWS icons.](https://aws.amazon.com/fr/architecture/icons/) 

### **âš¡Get started Now**
If budget is a concern, I highly recommend starting with Draw.io.<br>
There's even an [extension available in VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.vscode-drawio) for you to design directly from your favorite IDE. 

I have included all the extensible files for your convenience. e.g. visit [week 8.](week8.md)<br>
Meaning, you can easily begin by importing one of my architecture files to DRAWIO and make edits on top. 

*Happy diagramming*!

## Creating **Logical Diagram**
Logical diagrams are more detailed than conceptual diagrams. 
> Communicate the system's design to developers.

- **System architecture:** The system will be a three-tier architecture, consisting of a presentation layer, a business logic layer, and a data access layer.<br>
- **Data flow:** The data flow will be unidirectional, with users entering data into the presentation layer, which will then pass the data to the business logic layer for processing. 

This also effectively showcases the diverse components comprising the Cruddur product ecosystem.

<img src="assets/week0/media/logical-design.png">

The business logic layer will then pass the data to the data access layer for storage. 

### Unveiling the Application Layers
An application layer is a software layer that provides a set of services for the application. The application layer is responsible for interacting with the user, processing business logic, and accessing data.

**The application layer is typically divided into three sublayers,**

- **User interface layer:** The user interface layer is responsible for interacting with the user. It provides a way for the user to input data and view output.
- **Business logic layer:** The business logic layer is responsible for processing business logic. It implements the rules and procedures that define the application's functionality.
- **Data access layer:** The data access layer is responsible for accessing data. It provides a way for the application to store and retrieve data from a database or other data source.

The application layer is a critical part of any software application. 

The application layer should be well-designed, well-implemented, and well-tested to ensure that the application is reliable and secure.

## Creating **Conceptual Design**

Overall idea and scope to create a system that will allow users to share information and collaborate on projects. Conceptual diagrams are often drawn on napkins or whiteboards, hence the nickname "napkin designs.

With genuine enthusiasm and a touch of artistic flair, I created this captivating design, delicately sketching every stroke with two pens - one dipped in serene blue and the other ablaze with passionate red. We hope you like it!

I ensured that the architecture was designed with the following key features in mind:
- Secure Platform: considering Security best practices (refer to Journal).
- Robust Data Storage System: A reliable and scalable data storage system was integrated.

<img src="assets/week0/Cruddur-Architecture/cruddur-architecture.jpg">

When designing, the following constraints were also put forward.
- The system must be scalable to accommodate a large number of users.
- The system must be affordable to operate with costs considerations (refer to Journal).

I believe you'll greatly appreciate my design, so I've provided it in [PDF format](assets/week0/Cruddur-Architecture/cruddur-architecture.pdf) for your convenience and enjoyment.

## **Creating CI/CD Flow**

Outlined below is the CI/CD pipeline I have designed, which aims to automate the process of code integration, testing, and deployment. This pipeline fosters collaboration and accelerates the delivery of high-quality software, facilitating a more responsive development environment.

- Developer commits code to GitHub repository.
- AWS CodePipeline is triggered.
- The pipes are stored in the S3 pipeline bucket.
- Code changes are retrieved from AWS CodeCommit and passed to AWS CodeBuild.
- CodeBuild compiles and builds the application artifacts.
- AWS CodeDeploy deploys the artifacts to the target environment.

<img src="assets/week0/media/CICD-Arch.png">

Week zero marked the initial phase of our journey towards establishing robust DevOps and CI/CD pipelines. 

The real progress and significant advancements were witnessed [during week 9](week9.md). <br>Throughout this, we delved deep into the realm of DevOps and CI/CD pipelines, where the focus shifted from theoretical concepts to hands-on implementation and real-world application.

# Frameworks for Efficient Design
Frameworks are a valuable tool for any designer, architect or a *technologist*. 

Frameworks are essential for reducing complexity, minimizing errors, and making the design process more efficient. 

Frameworks provide a common language and methodology for teams to follow, which can help to ensure that everyone is on the same page and that the final product meets the desired requirements.

## The Open Group Architecture Framework
TOGAF is a widely used framework for enterprise architecture. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and techniques for designing, implementing, and managing enterprise architecture. TOGAF is structured into four main components:

- **Architecture Development Method:** A systematic approach to creating and implementing enterprise architecture.
- **Enterprise Continuum:** A classification scheme for organizing architecture artifacts.
- **Architecture Content Framework:** Defining the necessary skills, processes, and tools for efficient enterprise architecture development and management.
- **Architecture Capability Framework:** Establishing the core content of enterprise architecture.

## Paving the Way for Robust Systems
Emphasizing six critical pillars, the AWS Well-Architected Tool fosters the creation of highly reliable, secure, performant, and cost-efficient systems, while enabling agile responses to changing market trends and customer needs. 

**These pillars are,**
| Pillar | Focus |
| --- | --- |
| Operational Excellence | Utilizing a fully automated operations pipeline for IT operations |
| Security | Ensuring that security accounts are always up to date |
| Reliability | Building highly reliable systems that self-heal and recover quickly |
| Performance Efficiency | Ensuring that systems are running at peak performance efficiently |
| Cost Optimization | Reducing costs by utilizing cost optimization principles |
| Business Agility | Enabling rapid responses to changing customer requirements and market trends |

## Empowering Design with AWS Well-Architected Framework

The AWS Well-Architected Framework can be used to assess the current state of your applications and to identify areas where you can improve your architecture. 

The tool also provides recommendations for how to improve your architecture.

The AWS Well-Architected Framework incorporates a set of insightful questions aligned with the aforementioned pillars of the well-architected approach. 

Based on the inputs provided, the framework generates a comprehensive report, aiding businesses in achieving optimal and sustainable design outcomes.

<img src="assets/week0/media/aws-arch-frame-service.png">

***aws***
:  Is a term I use before a name to refer the act of searching a service in the console.

To get started, from the console aws `AWS Well-Architected`.



# Security Considerations
AWS is literally a secure cloud platform, but it is as important to implement additional security measures to protect your data and applications. 

> Zero Trust, Verify Explicitly.

![Zero Trust](assets/week0/zero-trust.png)

- **Use strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.** Use IAM to create and manage users and roles, and requiring multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users with access to sensitive data.
- **Implement network security.** This includes using security groups to control network traffic, and enabling encryption for data in transit and at rest.
- **Continuously monitor your resources.** Employ CloudTrail to track all API calls, and CloudWatch to monitor resource usage and performance.
- **Use secure coding practices.** Write code that is free of vulnerabilities, and using secure development practices such as code reviews and penetration testing.

| **Security Increase** | **Description** |
|---:|---|
| Data Protection & Residency | Protect your data by encrypting it at rest and in transit, and storing it in a region that meets your compliance requirements. |
| Governance & Compliance | Use the right AWS services and configure them correctly, and regularly audit your AWS environment to ensure that it is compliant with your security policies. |
| Shared Responsibility of Threat Detection | AWS takes responsibility for the security of the underlying cloud infrastructure, but you are responsible for the security of your data and applications. This includes detecting and responding to threats. |
| Incident Response Plans | Have a plan in place for responding to security incidents, including steps for identifying, containing, and remediating incidents. |

During camping, we addressed most security considerations. Below, you will find more of what matters. 

- **Use the principle of least privilege.** This means only giving users the permissions they need to perform their jobs, and no more.
- **Segment your network.** This will help to isolate your resources in case of a security breach.
- **Back up your data regularly.** To recover from a data breach or other disaster.
- **Have a disaster recovery plan.** Better restore your services in the event of a disaster.

Additionally, for CloudWatch configurations and continuous monitoring during the 12-week period and beyond, you can [refer back to week two](week2.md#monitor-flaskapp-with-cloudwatch).





## How to Apply MFA to the AWS Root User

The root user is the most powerful user in an AWS account, so it is important to secure it properly. 

One way to do this is to enable multi-factor authentication. MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide two forms of identification when they sign in.

To enable MFA for the root user, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the **AWS Management Console** as the root user.
2. In the navigation bar, choose **Your Account**, then **Security Credentials**.
3. In the **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** section, choose **Assign MFA device**.
4. Follow the instructions to configure your MFA device.

<img src="assets/week0/MFA1.png">

- AWS strongly recommends enforcing MFA for all organization resources without any exceptions.

Once you have enabled MFA for the root user, you will need to provide your MFA token when you sign in. <br>
This will help to protect your account from unauthorized access.

## What is an AWS Organization Unit?
An AWS Organization Unit (OU) is a logical grouping of AWS accounts within an AWS Organization. OUs can be used to organize and manage AWS accounts more effectively, and to simplify account management tasks.

**Why use AWS Organization Units?**
- **To organize your AWS accounts by business unit, department, or application.** This can make it easier to track costs, assign permissions, and manage compliance.
- **To simplify account management tasks.** For example, you can use OUs to set up billing and cost allocation, and to apply policies to groups of accounts.
- **To improve security.** You can use OUs to restrict access to resources, and to enforce security policies.

**How to create an AWS Organization Unit**

To create an AWS Organization Unit, you can use the AWS Organizations console or the AWS CLI. Here are the steps to create an OU using the console:

1. Go to the AWS Organizations console.
2. Click the **Organization Units** tab.
3. Click the **Create organizational unit** button.
4. Enter a name for the OU.
5. (Optional) Enter a description for the OU.
6. Click the **Create** button.

You can now use it to organize your AWS accounts and to simplify account management tasks by business unit, application or department. 



##  Managing IAM Users and Roles in AWS
IAM users and roles are the foundation of AWS security. They allow you to control who can access your AWS resources and what they can do with them.
- **Roles:** A set of permissions that can be assumed by entities like users or services, allowing them to perform specific actions on AWS resources.
- **Policies:** JSON documents that define what actions are allowed or denied on AWS resources, providing fine-grained control over access permissions.

IAM users can be given specific roles to access AWS resources, which are controlled through policies assigned (technically attached) to these roles.



#### How to Set up an IAM User

An IAM user is an individual or application that uses AWS resources. To set up an IAM user, you need to:

1. Create a user name and password for the user.
2. (Optional) Tag the user with metadata.
3. Click next or "Suivant" ;)

<img src="assets/week0/IAM DONE.png">

## Email Addresses with Aliasing

AWS aliases are a way to create friendly names for AWS resources. For example, you could create an alias for an email address, a Lambda function, or a KMS key. 

**To create an AWS alias, you can take note of the following,**

- Use the **AWS CLI, the AWS Management Console, or the AWS SDKs**.
- AWS alias names must be **unique** within your **account** and **region**.
- WS alias names can contain **letters**, **numbers**, and the **characters** `-`, `_`, and `..`

**Some examples of valid AWS aliases Incl,**
- `example`
- `example-alias`
- `example.alias`
- `example+alias`

Here is how to create an alias for an email address using the AWS CLI:

```sh
aws ses create-alias --alias-name example --email-address example@example.com
```
- **aws ses:** This part of the command tells the AWS CLI to interact with the Amazon SES service.
- **create-alias:** This is the specific action that tells the AWS SES service to create an alias.
- **--alias-name example:** This option specifies the name of the alias you want to create. In this case, the alias name will be "example".
- **--email-address example@example.com:** This option specifies the email address to which the alias will be associated. In this case, the alias "example" will be associated with the email address "example@example.com".



### ðŸ“§ Real-World Application

Let's say you have an online store that sends order confirmation emails to customers.

The primary email address you use for sending these emails is `orders@boutiquoo.com` and this email address is already verified in Amazon SES.


You now want to create an alias for tracking emails related to order cancellations.

To do this, you can use the AWS CLI with the following command:
```sh
aws ses create-alias --alias-name order-cancellations --email-address orders@boutiquoo.com
```

- The alias name is "order-cancellations".
- The email address associated with the alias is `orders@boutiquoo.com`.
- The alias email address itself for `order-cancellations` is `order-cancellations@boutiquoo.com`


### Seamless IAM User Connection

Once you have set up an IAM user, you can connect to the AWS Management Console as that user. 
1. Open the AWS Management Console in a web browser.
2. In the sign-in dialog box, select **IAM user**.
3. Enter the user name and password for the IAM user.
4. Click **Sign in**.

<img src="assets/week0/hiiam.png">


### Crafting an Efficient AWS Role:

1. Select the type of role you want to create.
2. Attach a policy to the role that grants the role the permissions it needs to access your AWS resources.
3. (Optional) Tag the role with metadata.

<img src="assets/week0/media/role.png">


### Policy Attachment in AWS

1. Go to the IAM console in the AWS Management Console.
2. In the navigation pane, select **Policies**.
3. Select the policy that you want to attach.
4. Click **Attach Policy**.
5. Select the role or user group that you want to attach the policy to.
6. Click **Attach**.


<img src="assets/week0/media/attaching-policy.png">


### Service Control Policies
SCPs are a type of organization policy that you can use to manage permissions in your organization. 

- SCPs can help to simplify the management of permissions in an organization.
- SCPs can help to improve security by preventing unauthorized users from performing certain actions.
- SCPs can help to reduce costs by preventing users from creating unnecessary accounts or resources.

SCPs are enforced at the root of your organization, and they can be used to deny or allow specific actions for all accounts in your organization.

1. In the navigation IAM pane, select Service control policies.
2. Click Create policy.
3. In the Policy name field, enter a name for your SCP.
4. In the Policy document field, paste the JSON code for your SCP.
```JSON
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Action": [
                "organizations:LeaveOrganization"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```
5. Click Create.

Once you have created your SCP, you need to attach it to the root of your [organizational unit (OU)](#what-is-an-aws-organization-unit). 


1. In the navigation pane, select **Organization**.
2. In the **Accounts** tab, select the root of your organization or the OU that you want to attach the SCP to.
3. Click **Service control policies**.
4. Click **Attach policy**.
4. In the **Policy** list, select the SCP that you want to attach.
5. Click **Attach.**


| Information | Description |
|---:|---|
| SCP order of application | SCPs are applied in the order that they are attached.<br> The first SCP that matches an action will be the one that is enforced. |
| Multiple SCPs | You can attach multiple SCPs to the same root or OU.<br>  In this case, the SCPs will be evaluated in the order that they are attached. |
| IAM policy overrides | SCPs can be overridden by IAM policies. If an IAM policy grants a user or role permission to perform an action that is denied by an SCP, the IAM policy will take precedence. |

The SCP will now be applied to the root of your organization or to the OU that you selected.

## Integrate Health Dashboard with SNS using EventBridge

In this part, I'll walk you through the process of configuring a Sub/Pub system with SNS and EventBridge to enable notifications for your Health Dashboard.

The Health Dashboard is a critical component for monitoring the well-being of your application. It tracks vital metrics, such as server health, response times, and resource utilization.

Integrating the Health Dashboard with SNS via EventBridge, you can receive real-time notifications on important events and take immediate action when necessary.

**Step 1: Create an SNS Topic - Pub**


Begin by creating an SNS topic using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI):
```sh
aws sns create-topic --name eventbridge-alert
```

This command will return the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the newly created topic:
```JSON
{
    "TopicArn": "arn:aws:sns:ca-central-1:<aws-id>:eventbridge-alert"
}
```

**Step 2: Subscribe to the SNS Topic**

Next, subscribe to the SNS topic with your preferred communication channel (e.g., email) to receive notifications:
```sh
aws sns subscribe \
--topic-arn arn:aws:sns:<REGION>:<ACCOUNTID>:eventbridge-alert \
--protocol <email> \
--notification-endpoint <EMAIL>
```
The system will provide a response in JSON format. 

The response will include a key-value pair, where the key is "SubscriptionArn" and the value is "pending confirmation."
```JSON
{
    "SubscriptionArn": "pending confirmation"
}
```
Upon subscription, a confirmation email will be sent to the specified EMAIL, containing a confirmation link.
```txt
You have chosen to subscribe to the topic: 
arn:aws:sns:<aws-region>:<aws-id>:eventbridge-alert
To confirm this subscription, click or visit the link below (If this was in error no action is necessary): 
Confirm subscription
```

<img src="assets/week0/subs-to-topic.png">

- Please access the console and navigate to SNS to locate the confirmations<br> It will be listed in the subscription column.

<img src="assets/week0/sns-for-event-bridge.png">

**Step 3: Create an EventBridge Rule**


1. Use the [provided file](../aws/json/sns-event-bridge.json) to create an EventBridge rule that defines the event pattern:
```sh
aws events put-rule --name "sns-eventbridge-health" \
--event-pattern file://aws/json/sns-event-bridge.json
```

2. Upon successful execution, the command will return the ARN of the created rule:
```JSON
{
    "RuleArn": "arn:aws:events:ca-central-1:598485450821:rule/sns-eventbridge-health"
}
```
<img src="assets/week0/sns-eventbridge-health.png">

**Step 4: Add a Target to the Rule**
1. Finally, add the SNS topic as the target for the EventBridge rule:
```sh
aws events put-targets --rule sns-eventbridge-health --targets "Id"="1","Arn"="arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:<REDACTED>7434:eventbridge-alert"
```

If successful, the command will return a response indicating no failure entries:
```JSON
{
    "FailedEntryCount": 0,
    "FailedEntries": []
}
```

**Step 5: Navigate to the Console**

You have successfully integrated your Health Dashboard with SNS using EventBridge.
