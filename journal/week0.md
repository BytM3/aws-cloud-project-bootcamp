# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

This was a very introduction week. Not heavy instructions more to get folks a good welcome and get them on board.

- We discussed security and its importance
- Also the importance of good architecture going to the benefits of the microservice architecture.
- I also got the chance to have some hands on Lucidchart, i'm well practical with drawio & visio at work so this felt very similar
- We then discussed some AWS stuff and the importance of working under an IAM rather than root.
- We did great operations related to budget, alerts and to have sense of your expenses on AWS Cost explorer.

Let's go on some of the things i worked on!

It is not required, but the knowledge it contains is super fun.
