# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

This was a very introduction week. Not heavy instructions more to get folks a good welcome and get them on board.

- We discussed security and its importance
- Also the importance of good architecture going to the benefits of the microservice architecture.
- I also got the chance to have some hands on Lucidchart, i'm well practical with drawio & visio at work so this felt very similar
- We then discussed some AWS stuff and the importance of working under an IAM rather than root.
- We did great operations related to budget, alerts and to have sense of your expenses on AWS Cost explorer.

Here is a reminder for you.

| Pillar | Focus |
| --- | --- |
| Operational Excellence | Utilizing a fully automated operations pipeline for IT operations |
| Security | Ensuring that security accounts are always up to date |
| Reliability | Building highly reliable systems that self-heal and recover quickly |
| Performance Efficiency | Ensuring that systems are running at peak performance efficiently |
| Cost Optimization | Reducing costs by utilizing cost optimization principles |
| Business Agility | Enabling rapid responses to changing customer requirements and market trends |


Let's go on some of the things i worked on!


# 1- Creating Architecture 
I loved the beard guy and how he mentioned about TOGAF Certification, it's a pursue of a high entreprise architects. Maybe, i'll consider it going further.
It is not required, but the knowledge it contains is super fun.


## So i started with this, great and simple!

That was it my essay with these charts, You can play with my work from [here](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/f03569ad-27eb-435d-a81e-4c0d404e5951/edit?viewport_loc=-513%2C135%2C2720%2C1216%2CwcSxugjtXe~j&invitationId=inv_d8a1495b-87a4-4031-80bf-08a7067c8e12).


Andrew has provided more great architecture, such as the Twitter System Arch and others that may be useful; check them out from [here!](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/3dd58bb4-27dc-440d-9dc0-9bcd0154a346/edit?viewport_loc=224%2C471%2C1939%2C867%2Cu~1sbYNXU9q3&invitationId=inv_b811bc56-a51b-4481-a306-2f347e725dc5)

### $ AWS ACCOUNT ID process

get the id

aws sts get-caller-identity
```
 or? 

```
aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account

```


or without " " ?

```
aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text

```
env grep ACCOUNT

Checking have this from Chirag video "ops", this will stay that way even later because this is region sensitive.
<img src="assets/week0/CLI-WORK/10 sns topic from ops is here.png">

### Create SNS

```
aws sns create-topic --name CLI-billing-alarm
```

<img src="assets/week0/CLI-WORK/11 sns cli create.png">

### Confirm SNS

```

<img src="assets/week0/CLI-WORK/13 SNS CLI CONFIRM MAIL.png">

### Mailed Confirmed
<img src="assets/week0/CLI-WORK/14 confirmed.png">

## Let's check with Canada Central!
<img src="assets/week0/CLI-WORK/15 here it is in the right region.png">
<img src="assets/week0/CLI-WORK/16 perfect .png">

## CloudWatch

```
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --cli-input-json file://aws/json/alarm_config.json
```
