# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

This was a very introduction week. Not heavy instructions more to get folks a good welcome and get them on board.

- We discussed security and its importance
- Also the importance of good architecture going to the benefits of the microservice architecture.
- I also got the chance to have some hands on Lucidchart, i'm well practical with drawio & visio at work so this felt very similar
- We then discussed some AWS stuff and the importance of working under an IAM rather than root.
- We did great operations related to budget, alerts and to have sense of your expenses on AWS Cost explorer.

Here is a reminder for you.

| Pillar | Focus |
| --- | --- |
| Operational Excellence | Utilizing a fully automated operations pipeline for IT operations |
| Security | Ensuring that security accounts are always up to date |
| Reliability | Building highly reliable systems that self-heal and recover quickly |
| Performance Efficiency | Ensuring that systems are running at peak performance efficiently |
| Cost Optimization | Reducing costs by utilizing cost optimization principles |
| Business Agility | Enabling rapid responses to changing customer requirements and market trends |


Let's go on some of the things i worked on!


# 1- Creating Architecture 
I loved the beard guy and how he mentioned about TOGAF Certification, it's a pursue of a high entreprise architects. Maybe, i'll consider it going further.
It is not required, but the knowledge it contains is super fun.

That was it my essay with these charts, You can play with my work from [here](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/f03569ad-27eb-435d-a81e-4c0d404e5951/edit?viewport_loc=-513%2C135%2C2720%2C1216%2CwcSxugjtXe~j&invitationId=inv_d8a1495b-87a4-4031-80bf-08a7067c8e12).


Andrew has provided more great architecture, such as the Twitter System Arch and others that may be useful; check them out from [here!](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/3dd58bb4-27dc-440d-9dc0-9bcd0154a346/edit?viewport_loc=224%2C471%2C1939%2C867%2Cu~1sbYNXU9q3&invitationId=inv_b811bc56-a51b-4481-a306-2f347e725dc5)

# Create a Budget

Creating using the JSON.


Type this in your terminal interface
```
aws budgets create-budget \
    --account-id $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID \
    --budget file://aws/json/budget.json \
    --notifications-with-subscribers file://aws/json/budget-notifications-with-subscribers.json

```

You should have the file in the exact same path. If you wish to have it on root (not a good practice) take the `/aws.`

[Here r the files](../aws/json/README.md) used


## Result:
