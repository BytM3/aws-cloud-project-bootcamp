# Student Portal Tour

The student portal is where we can access information about weekly tasks and assignments that need to be completed and submitted.

The student portal is also a valuable source of information, providing access to resources, special discounts, and a wide range of materials that can enhance our learning experience.

The student portal also serves as a centralized hub for bootcamp organizers to track enrolled students and gain direction to the work they're doing. This includes links to GitHub projects, AWS IDs, Discord handles, domain names, and other essential resources.

I took this opportunity to provide you with a brief tour of what's happening on the inside. Have fun!

During the learning journey, students will need to refer to additional resources and documents to stay on top of the weekly challenges.
