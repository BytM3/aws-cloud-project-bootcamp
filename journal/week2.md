# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing

<img src="assets/week2/welcome.png">

The good times continue!

This past week was a great dive into the world of troubleshooting and the importance of observability for us; software developers.

I started by learning about the three main observability pillars: metrics, traces, and logs. 

I gained a deeper understanding of how each of these pillars can provide valuable insights into the performance of software applications & help to identify and resolve issues quickly.

I succesfully setup CRUDDUR to four different observability tools: Honeycomb, AWS X-Ray, CloudWatch, and Rollbar.

Here is a brief on the tools, if you consider learning more.

|  Tools         | Description                                          |
|-------------| -----------------------------------------------------|
| [Honeycomb](#honeycomb-dive)   |  Honeycomb is a distributed tracing & observability platform to help engineers understand and debug complex systems. |
| [AWS X-Ray](#instrument-aws-x-ray)   |  AWS X-Ray is a tracing service provided by AWS that helps analyze and debug distributed applications.  |
| [CloudWatch](#aws-cloudwatch)  |Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service provided by AWS |
| [Rollbar](#rollbar)  |Rollbar is a cloud-based error and log monitoring tool  helps identify software errors in real-time.  |


Through careful analysis of the data generated, I was capable to effectively identify and resolve numerous critical issues, allowing me to make data-driven decisions that led to real improvements in the performance and stability of the app.


There were two practices I was doing that are worth mentioning:

- **Instrumentation**, which is the practice of adding code to a software application in order to capture data about its performance or behavior, most onboarding to the tools was taking this putting that and troubleshoot in between.
- **Distrubuted Tracing**, it is a technique for tracking the path of a request as it flows through a distributed system or application.

In a distributed system, a single request can touch many different components, services, and systems, and tracking the path of that request can be challenging. This is what these tools can help us in achieving.


Very decent accumulated knowledge, and there is still more related to acquire. 

Take a look at the work completed thus far below!



# Honeycomb Dive


## A- Set Honeycomb API Env Var

```
export HONEYCOMB_API_KEY="Kk4cyhQ9zhCxNKg1BzyCyA"
```

```
gp env HONEYCOMB_API_KEY="Kk4cyhQ9zhCxNKg1BzyCyA"
```

<img src="assets/week2/heyhoney/1 set api key env var.png">

## B-Hard code Service Name  in docker compose

<img src="assets/week2/heyhoney/2- include api key and others requirement for honeycomb.png">

You may ask why not these and gg?

```
export HONEYCOMB_SERVICE_NAME="Cruddur" //cruddur Service name in span 
```

```
gp env HONEYCOMB_SERVICE_NAME="Cruddur"
```

:lamp: Because you dont want it to be consistent as your backend services may vary.


## C- Configure Open Telemetry to send for honeycomb

```
      OTEL_SERVICE_NAME: "backend-flask" 
```

Automatic Instrumentation isnt as good in the frontend.


#  Send Data to required backend lang  dependent

## 1-  Install your backend required language packages

go to backend

```
cd backend-flask
```

Run

```
pip install opentelemetry-api 
```
<img src="assets/week2/heyhoney/3 install required packages.png">

Include all the packages in requirement.txt
```
opentelemetry-api
opentelemetry-sdk 
opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-http 
opentelemetry-instrumentation-flask 
opentelemetry-instrumentation-requests
```


Run requirement txt to get the packages installed since python isnt that good in package management ;)

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
<img src="assets/week2/heyhoney/4 installed them from txt file.png">


## 2- Initialize

add this to app.py

- This before main 

```
# HoneyComb things for reference 1-----
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.instrumentation.flask import FlaskInstrumentor
from opentelemetry.instrumentation.requests import RequestsInstrumentor
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.http.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor


# HoneyComb things for reference 2-----
# Initialize tracing and an exporter that can send data to Honeycomb
provider = TracerProvider()
processor = BatchSpanProcessor(OTLPSpanExporter())
provider.add_span_processor(processor)
trace.set_tracer_provider(provider)
tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)
```

A this should be after main `app = Flask(__name__)`


```
# HoneyComb things for reference 3-----
FlaskInstrumentor().instrument_app(app)
RequestsInstrumentor().instrument()
```

Instructed from:
<img src="assets/week2/heyhoney/6 proof init honeycomb instructions.png">

<img src="assets/week2/heyhoney/5 honeycomb init.png">

Making code explicit, env var are sneaky. 

Env var are technically easy but.


## D- Docker Compose up
No need to build the container, it will do it for us. Simple let the docker compose do the magic.

ERROR!

<img src="assets/week2/heyhoney/7- try to hit endpointERROR.png">



## Troubleshoot
<img src="assets/week2/heyhoney/8 troubleshoot solution.png">

added this 
```
# Show this in the logs within the backend-flask app (STDOUT)
simple_processor = SimpleSpanProcessor(ConsoleSpanExporter())
provider.add_span_processor(simple_processor)
```

and imported its librairy
```
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import ConsoleSpanExporter, SimpleSpanProcessor
```

and then go try the endpoint once more


Oh it shows data now!
<img src="assets/week2/heyhoney/9 reloading data and getting some spans now.png">


## Honeycomb dont show?

- Check again

env | grep HONEY

It is there.


go to 

honeycomb-whoami.glitch.me to find out what api is that..

<img src="assets/week2/heyhoney/replace.png">

# Restart fresh
<img src="assets/week2/heyhoney/replace2.png">

<img src="assets/week2/heyhoney/12 update npm front.png">

## Let's automate this in gitpod
<img src="assets/week2/npm auto.png">

## And make ports unlocked by default in gitpod

<img src="assets/week2/related make port open by default in gitpod.png">



### Solved, here is the dashbaord showing data.

## I Added Spans:

- 1:Aquiring a tracer:


Go to an api endpoint like the home_activites.py endpoint & add this:

This will help using only the opentelemetryAPI, cause there is fat pack of import.

```
from opentelemetry import trace
tracer = trace.get_tracer("home.activities")
```
- 2: Creating Spans afte def run():

```
with tracer.start_as_current_span("home-activities-mock"):
```


add these after and align to identation to adding Attributes to Spans external-link

```
span = trace.get_current_span()
span.set_attribute("user.id", user.id())
```

# Instrument AWS X-Ray

### Install AWS SDK


<img src="assets/week2/XRAY/1 isntall sdk.png">



## Create group

<img src="assets/week2/XRAY/2 json.png">

```
aws xray create-group \
   --group-name "Cruddur" \
   --filter-expression "service(\"backend-flask\")
```
<img src="assets/week2/XRAY/3 crfeate groip.png">



### Here it is

<img src="assets/week2/XRAY/4- Its here to group traces together..png">

## Sampling 

a good way to ask it to show you what you really need.

```
aws xray create-sampling-rule --cli-input-json file://aws/json/xray.json
```

<img src="assets/week2/XRAY/5 sample using json.png">

Create it using CLI using the xray.json

You can do it using aws console. However listen brother, UI changes json dont ;)
