cloudformation can be written in json or yaml


nested stacks are good but not our case?


to seach for a service, search for snippet: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/quickref-ecs.html#quickref-ecs-example-1.yaml

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/emr/create-cluster.html


aws map the api to both cfn and cli THE SAME API dude


cloudformer 2 helps


( cloudscape design ui - this design for code catalyst and soon will go all over)

Required focus:
- cloudformation guard cli github project
- use cloudformation designer
