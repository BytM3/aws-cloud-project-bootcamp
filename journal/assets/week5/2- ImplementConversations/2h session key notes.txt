- create ddb.py (add the required)
- IF EXISTS cruddur in db seed again
- list convo updates


- create a script to populate user ID to MOCK seed.sql(db)
     - under bin/ 
             -create cognito/list-users (make sure to have export AWS_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=etc from coginito AND GP ENV
             - go to docker composer and assign the value of env var "${}"
             - finaly chmod it and run it
     - the script to update is called: db/update/cognito-user-ids and exe it
     - another param to the lib db.py

- add script to the setup
  line 7 print ("----db cognito chbyh why why")

- seed our data ./bin/db/seed

(error with update rule) - solu

- get the connection url to local in docker compose
- adjust app.py
- message-groups.py services code required
- create db/users/uuid_from_handle.sql - very simple query

---
update msg= no results [ERROR 401]AT THIS POINT WE HAVE PROBLEM WITH THE TOKEN BEING EXPIRED
---


inspecter les element=> NETWORK TAB - go message groups headers and anayze

solved we got to update our client side javascript:

- go to homefeed.js 
    - take cookie we dont do it anymore 
    - copy the syntax for header token to pages/messagegroupSpagejs and pages/messageGrouPpagejs and components/MessageForm.js


--
stil no message data but 500 error still better then 400
---

to test:

try to go to postgre local
and select * from users; if its still mock so the uuid didnt get updated

try the update-uuid command again and then go back to psql and select again


---
still error
--

we try to get the auth function solo from homefeedpage
and go import it there instead and check authorization after loading it
DO THE SAME FOR messagegroup and message groups


next:

- ddb schema load
- dddb seeed

---
troubleshooting the empty []
----


HAHA AWS_ENDPOINT_URL include in compose

----

After that we should see our seed conversation. :D

---

now instead of @handler at the top we should have the UUID url in the message so in app.js

this must be passed to messagegroup.py	 
now lib ddb time steps
