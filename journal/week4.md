# Week 4 â€” SQL Databases

In week four, I had the opportunity to delve into the powerful open-source relational database management system. PostgreSQL.


<img src="assets/week4/Week4 banner.png">

I connected to Postgres locally and wrote scripts to automate tasks like table creation, seeding, schema, and database deletion.

I then combined the init process into a single script with a visually appealing color to make it easier to set up the database in the next time.

I also used the seed to query the user and activities data.

After having completed the local tasks, I created an AWS RDS instance and connected to it from my development environment.

I whereupon updated my scripts to check for the prod arg and connect to the  required db using conditional statement.

Eventually, I worked on deploying Python-based function to AWS Lambda, and used CloudWatch logs for clear troubleshooting.

The CRUD activities were done properly, and I posted Two great posts, which I tracked using RDS on Gitpod and in the product UI.


To connect my work, please see the table of contents below!

## Postgre Set:
<img src="assets/week4/2- localwork/1 prereq init cli and server.png">

## Back to Postgre:
<img src="assets/week4/2- localwork/2 opla we are back.png">

## Listing Databases:
<img src="assets/week4/2- localwork/3 my databases.png">

## Creating Cruddur database:
<img src="assets/week4/2- localwork/4 create db.png">

## Adding UUID:
<img src="assets/week4/2- localwork/5 adding  UUI to have it always.png">

## Creating the extension: 
<img src="assets/week4/2- localwork/6 executing extension.png">

## Setting Service Connection:
<img src="assets/week4/2- localwork/7 setting service connection.png">

## Connection URL:
<img src="assets/week4/2- localwork/8 co url done.png">

## Prod Connection URL:
> I shoudn't hide any pw in the first place, i changed all.

<img src="assets/week4/2- localwork/9 set up prod connection.png">

## Shebang and path:

This will be treated as bash even tho you see no extensions.

And this scripts will be used to interact with the db. Sounds fun, right?

<img src="assets/week4/2- localwork/10 continue with db treate this files as bash scripts.png">

## Consider Files Not executed by default:
<img src="assets/week4/2- localwork/11 we known that files not exec bydefault.png">

## Consult current permissions:
> Learn about [Linux?](https://linux.yahya-abulhaj.dev/)


<img src="assets/week4/2- localwork/12 permissions.png">

## Changing mode:
<img src="assets/week4/2- localwork/13 exec not just for user but all of em incl groups.png">

## Giving permission:
<img src="assets/week4/2- localwork/13 giving permission to one file.png">

## User have the execution
After created the 3 scripts i gave them the X for me.

<img src="assets/week4/2- localwork/14 looking for this.png">

## Drop concern:
<img src="assets/week4/2- localwork/15 exec drop hmm.png">

## Exclusion required:
<img src="assets/week4/2- localwork/16 we have to exclude this because not just its creating but also dropping there.png">

## Sed is RESOLVER:
<img src="assets/week4/2- localwork/17 using sed will solve it.png">

## Lets explain it:

```SQL
sed 's/\/cruddur//g'
```
To get rid of `/` do `\` infront of it

for this `/cruddur//` It will take it and change it with empty using `//`


Now let's feed it to our connection string:

```SQL
sed 's/\/cruddur//g' <<< "$CONNECTION_URL"
```

WRAPPING in dollar sign so we can assign it to our env var

```SQL
NO_DB_CONNECTION=$(sed 's/\/cruddur//g' <<< "$CONNECTION_URL"
```

## Dropping:
<img src="assets/week4/2- localwork/18 db drop done ofc pro.png">

# Implementing CRUD Activities

<img src="assets/week4/7- DB Activities/1 re design db lib.png">


## Workflow: 

<img src="assets/week4/7- DB Activities/2 too much coding.png">

<img src="assets/week4/7- DB Activities/3 include this code.png">


<img src="assets/week4/7- DB Activities/4 cleaing home activity.png">

## Analyzing:
<img src="assets/week4/7- DB Activities/5 analyze this.png">


## SQL Portability:
<img src="assets/week4/7- DB Activities/6 take sql outside.png">


## Home SQL:
<img src="assets/week4/7- DB Activities/7 home sql.png">


<img src="assets/week4/7- DB Activities/7 b.png">



## Create Activity:
<img src="assets/week4/7- DB Activities/8 for create activity.png">



## Activity maker:
<img src="assets/week4/7- DB Activities/9 activity maker.png">



<img src="assets/week4/7- DB Activities/10 doing hard work.png">


## Loading template:
<img src="assets/week4/7- DB Activities/12 loading templates.png">

## Creating the object:
<img src="assets/week4/7- DB Activities/14 object sql.png">


## Security over injections:
<img src="assets/week4/7- DB Activities/15 security over injection.png">


## Goin in here:
<img src="assets/week4/7- DB Activities/16 going to this.png">



## Lambda Para again:
<img src="assets/week4/7- DB Activities/17 and parameteres to lamnbda.png">


## Required dependency:
<img src="assets/week4/7- DB Activities/18 adding db requird depe.png">


## Code:
<img src="assets/week4/7- DB Activities/19 create this template class.png">


## Taking this:
<img src="assets/week4/7- DB Activities/20 taking ths.png">


## Including para:
<img src="assets/week4/7- DB Activities/21 including para.png">


## And this:
<img src="assets/week4/7- DB Activities/22 now attacking tis part.png">

## Multi2db query:
<img src="assets/week4/7- DB Activities/23 multi to db quer.png">


## That way:
<img src="assets/week4/7- DB Activities/24 this way.png">


## Then this:
<img src="assets/week4/7- DB Activities/25 next attack.png">



## As such:
<img src="assets/week4/7- DB Activities/26 as such.png">


## Testing:
<img src="assets/week4/7- DB Activities/27 test on.png" >


## Taking this:
<img src="assets/week4/7- DB Activities/28 and take this.png">



## Coloring for clarity:
<img src="assets/week4/7- DB Activities/29 blue for fun.png">



## Green in here:
<img src="assets/week4/7- DB Activities/29 green for fun.png">

This to help debug later.

## Secured:
<img src="assets/week4/7- DB Activities/CRUD-TEST/2 secure lambda.png">


## Up:
<img src="assets/week4/7- DB Activities/CRUD-TEST/3 building our software.png">

## Unable to crud:

<img src="assets/week4/7- DB Activities/CRUD-TEST/9 honestly idk.png">


## Debugging:
<img src="assets/week4/7- DB Activities/CRUD-TEST/10 If you do not wish to make these changes, the simplest solution (for one user) would be to replace the hardcoded user_handle value with your own username.png">


## Let's see:
<img src="assets/week4/7- DB Activities/CRUD-TEST/11 lets see.png">



## Hm, why.
<img src="assets/week4/7- DB Activities/CRUD-TEST/12 why.png">

### Extra;

| **Security Quiz**  | Answer |
| :--- | :--- |
| Which of the following databases would you NOT find available as an option on the AWS RDS service? | DynamoDB |
| Which of the following CIDR notations means you want to target any/all possible addresses? | 0.0.0.0/0 |
| Which AWS Service can be used in conjunction with RDS to help rotate access keys regularly? | Secrets Manager |
| True or False, best practice dictates your RDS instance should never be publicly available on the internet | TRUE |  |


| Alternatives and Considerations                              |
|:-------------------------------------------------------------|
| We require a Postgres service if we plan into AuthN which will rely on Postgres to store users for authentication. |
| I want both an OnLine Transaction Processing (OLTP) and an OLAP in this project. |
| Redshift Serverless could be used as an OLAP.                |
| DDB Streams to S3 and then Athena caching to Momento could have been possible as well for our OLAP like solution. |
| When creating security group rules for your RDS instance, only allow private network access with rules targeting specific security groups  |
