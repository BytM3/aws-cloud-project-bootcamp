# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

<img src="assets/week1/week1.png">

This week was jam-packed of hands-on. 


I created a `Dockerfiles` and built the Docker containers for both the front end & the backend. 

I then ran each individually before configuring Docker Compose to run both containers // with `docker-compose up`.

In the front end, I installed required dependencies and packages, such as `react-scripts`, and made certain that package installations were correctly directory-targeted. 

In addition, I learned more about React components and patterns, which were relatively simple in comparison to the backend.


Moving on to the backend with Flask on top of the great Python, I installed some packages and added 'em to the backend directory's gitignore file. 

I also learned more about APIs & the services features towards a microservice architecture, and `README.IO` proved to be a useful tool for creating API documentation.

With the above said, I worked on adding the notification feature to the website. 

Wrapping, I configured Postgres in `.gitpod` along AWS CLI required commands  which is included in [Week0 journal](week0.md), connecting to the database, and performed basic database operations.

I also installed DynamoDB using AWS CLI and performed additional database operations such as table creation and listing

Overall, it was a fantastic week filled with invaluable practical learning opportunities.

Have a look below, But first let me know?

### New to DOCKER? Check DOCKER 101 ðŸ‘‡

### Week objectives:
- work with flask 
- dockerize using dockerfile
- docker-compose for running more than a container //
- troubleshoot using debugger, the error code and everything in between



#### Prereq 
- Docker extension
- Install Flask on top of py
- NPM for reactjs to use react-scripts


## Backend work:
### Install Flask
<img src="assets/week1/install%20flask.png">

### Install Flask Core
<img src="assets/week1/installed%20flask%20core.png">



### Docker Run issue, Env Variable
<img src="assets/week1/docker run didnt work first because we didnt set envi variable.png">

### Logs Troubleshoot

### Server is working

### building docker image

### Success Build

### Docker PS from BASH

### Listing current images

### working ports

### Data is here

### Docker Run
<img src="assets/week1/11docker run.png">

<img src="assets/week1/12 docker run the 5th.png">


## Frontend

Front end is honestly easier, same process, the only diff is the docker compose to be able to run both dockers same time and get ur app running and functional with backend.


### NPM required
<img src="assets/week1/frontend npom install.png">


### Building front docker, using the dockerfile ofc
<img src="assets/week1/build docker front.png">

### Some stats of what i have 
<img src="assets/week1/statas.png">

## Result Front Container

<img src="assets/week1/APP LIVE.png">


### The union port issue
You have to shutdown the frontend container since it will be used by docker compose later when running the entire app.
<img src="assets/week1/The everything ports.png">

### Docker compose, using compose up or from terminal
<img src="assets/week1/docker compose to build both containers.png">

# Troubleshooting

This didnt work cause i forgot to install npm which itself will require the react scripts required for our front end reactjs application frontend

## This command was a game changer

# Dynamo Local


AWS check to use for dynamoDB

<img src="assets/week1/1-aws is here.png">

## Create DB
```
aws dynamodb create-table \
    --endpoint-url http://localhost:8000 \
    --table-name Music \
    --attribute-definitions \
        AttributeName=Artist,AttributeType=S \
        AttributeName=SongTitle,AttributeType=S \
    --key-schema AttributeName=Artist,KeyType=HASH AttributeName=SongTitle,KeyType=RANGE \
    --provisioned-throughput ReadCapacityUnits=1,WriteCapacityUnits=1 \
    --table-class STANDARD
```


<img src="assets/week1/dynamo work/1 dynamo table created.png">

<img src="assets/week1/dynamo work/2.png">



## Create an Item
```

aws dynamodb put-item \
    --endpoint-url http://localhost:8000 \
    --table-name Music \
    --item \
        '{"Artist": {"S": "No One You Know"}, "SongTitle": {"S": "Call Me Today"}, "AlbumTitle": {"S": "Somewhat Famous"}}' \
    --return-consumed-capacity TOTAL  
```



<img src="assets/week1/dynamo work/3 create item.png">



## list Tables


```
aws dynamodb list-tables --endpoint-url http://localhost:8000
```

<img src="assets/week1/dynamo work/4 list tables.png">



## Get Records

```
aws dynamodb scan --table-name cruddur_cruds --query "Items" --endpoint-url http://localhost:8000
```

<img src="assets/week1/dynamo work/5 get records.png">




# Postgres

Have it in `.gitpod`:

<img src="assets/week1/Postgre/1 postgre installed auto gitpod.png">


After going to DB Explorer and created a connection:

<img src="assets/week1/Postgre/2 connected to server .png">

Connect to postgres:
```
psql --host localhost
```

or our case Connect to postgres with password as pw (Picked it DB Explorer):

```
psql -Upostgres --host localhost
```
<img src="assets/week1/Postgre/3 enter postgre.png">


- This will get you into Postgres

### Database Stuff
to find relations:
```
\d
```


to check tuples on or off:
```
\t
```


to see ID owner and description:

```
\dl
```


to see templates:

```
\l
```

<img src="assets/week1/Postgre/4 perform postgre.png">


## Finished work? Quit DB

<img src="assets/week1/Postgre/5 quit postgre.png">
