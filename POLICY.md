We would like to bring to your attention that as part of the purposeful design of this project, certain credentials, intentionally and deliberately exposed within this environment are strictly intended for instructional and educational purposes.

**TL;DR** Be aware that the AWS user linked to these credentials is an [IAM entity](journal/week0.md#iam-user), explicitly configured to fulfill the requirements of this bootcamp, as part of our meticulous approach to security, we want to assure you that this IAM user, alongside all other associated credentials, will be promptly terminated upon the conclusion of duties and certain information is even ceased before its made available to the community.

We strongly discourage any attempt to use or access these credentials for any unauthorized activities.

In the spirit of maintaining transparency, we kindly request your full cooperation in adhering to this policy.

We assure you that appropriate security measures have been implemented to safeguard any sensitive information associated with these credentials throughout the duration of this undertaking.


Should you have any queries, concerns, or require further clarification regarding the handling of these credentials, we remain at your disposal. 

We value your participation to the our standards of confidentiality and security throughout this project.
