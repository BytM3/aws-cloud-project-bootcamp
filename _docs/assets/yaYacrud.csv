"Approach your work as if it were a game, and strive to excel as if it were a must.", "NEVER mistake the act of playing for lack of seriousness, as some games can be very serious indeed.", "Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes.", "You can't just sit around and wait for opportunities to come. YOU have to actively create them for yourself."
